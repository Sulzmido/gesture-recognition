Gesture recognition using HOG-SVM

1. Image Processing (RGB2GrayTransformer, HogTransformer).

    i) Read train_images as RGB from the filesystem.
    ii) Resize all images to 102(height) by 136(width).
    iii) Convert all images to grayscale.
    v) Compute Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for all images.

2. Scaling (StandardScalar).

    i) Standardize HOG image features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance
    ii) The standard score of a sample `x` is calculated as:

        z = (x - u) / s

        where `u` is the mean of the training samples,
        and `s` is the standard deviation of the training samples.

3. Training using SVC (Support Vector Classification)

    i) Train using svc model i.e  Fit transformed inputs to labels.
    ii) Save model for usage and metrics.
    iii) Save transformers [RGB2GrayTransformer, HogTransformer, StandardScaler] for usage and metrics.

4. Testing

    i) Restore svc model and transformers
    ii) Read test_image as RGB from filesystem
    iii) Resize image to 102*136
    iv) Apply all transformers on image in the right order [RGB2GrayTransformer -> HogTransformer -> StandardScaler]
    v) Use model to predict output.
